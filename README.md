### To Run
1. Host a local server: python -m http.server  
2. Open the mergeAttempt.html file on Safari -- Chrome unfortunately won't work. 

### Description 
This was a side project attempt to connect 2 different d3 visualizations: an adjacency matrix and a network graph. The hope was to see if connecting the 2 visualizations could provide a clearer insight into different entities relationships. 

Hovering over the adjacency matrix highlights the corresponding graph nodes. 

Clicking the graph nodes highlights the corresponding entities on the adjacency matrix - multi-selection is allowed. 

### Version 
This project was last developed in Jan. 2017. Future development in the following areas is needed to create a smoother user interaction: (1) multi-selection (2) de-selection (3) highlighting colors (4) organization of the visualizations (5) multiple browser support
